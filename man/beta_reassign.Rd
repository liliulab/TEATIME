\title{Reassign VAF Groups Based on Beta Distribution Probabilities}
\usage{
beta_reassign(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing VAF values and their associated probabilities.
The data frame must include columns named \code{vaf} and \verb{prob.<n>} where \verb{<n>}
represents different clusters.}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns \code{vaf}, \code{cluster}, and \code{freq}, where \code{cluster} is the
reassigned cluster number and \code{freq} is the frequency count of VAF values in each cluster.
}
\description{
This function processes a data frame of VAF values and their associated probabilities,
reassigning each VAF to a cluster based on the maximum probability. It calculates the
frequency of each VAF and distributes the VAFs into clusters accordingly.
